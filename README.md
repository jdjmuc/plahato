## **plahato** - A handy toolkit for the Play Framework

This toolkit library contains several handy tools for 
developing a good looking website with the Play Framework.

I developed this toolkit library to standardize handling common tasks like creating 
menu's and a photo gallery. It creates these components from a model and allows 
for different renderers for various toolkits. Currently, I am only using bootstrap and 
therefore only provide renderers for bootstrap.

The toolkit currently contains toolkits for the following:
* Basic utilities for loading content from a resources, caching and some transformations.
* A simple user authentication package.
* Model based components for rendering menu's and photo galleries.
* Utility for language handling.
